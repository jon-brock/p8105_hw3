## Problem #1
###### (*25 points*)
##### *Exploration of the Instacart Data*

The following code imports the `instacart` dataset from the courses' `p8105.datasets` github site. As we all know, Instacart is the online service that allows consumers to order grocery items from a store of their choosing, have someone pull the items from the shelf, bag them, and either deliver them or set them aside for fast and easy pickup.

Given how massive the dataset is for this problem, we are going to pull it from the `p8105.datasets` library and assign it as the `instacart` tibble, as well as remove an unnecessary column `eval_set`.

```{r generate_tibble_from_source_data_instacart}
instacart <- as_tibble(p8105.datasets::instacart) %>% 
    select(-eval_set)
```

The dataset `instacart` has `r ncol(instacart)` variables. There are variables that are specific to the items, such as `product_id`, `department`, `product_name`, and `aisle`. There are also variables that are specific to the consumer, such as `reordered`, `user_id`, `days_since_prior_order`, and `order_dow`.  This dataset has `r instacart %>% distinct(user_id) %>% count()` unique customers.


```{r high_order_aisles}
instacart %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    summarise(aisle_count = n()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(aisle_count))
```

As we can see from our previous code chunk, there are `r instacart %>% distinct(aisle) %>% count()` aisles.
And the top five aisles from which items are ordered are:

1. fresh vegetables  
1. fresh fruits  
1. packaged vegetable fruits  
1. yogurt  
1. packaged cheese  

```{r instacart_aisle_plot, fig.align = 'center'}
instacart %>% #CODE CHUNK COMPLETED
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    summarize(aisle_count = n()) %>% 
    filter(aisle_count > 10000) %>% 
    arrange(desc(aisle)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle_count, y = reorder(aisle, desc(aisle)))) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(
            title = "Most Ordered Item Categories via Instacart",
            x = "Number of Items Ordered",
            y = "Aisle")
```


```{r table_popular_aisle_items, eval = FALSE}
instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
    select(aisle, product_name, everything()) %>% 
    count(product_name)

    summarize(product_name = n()) %>% 
    
    group_by(product_name, aisle_count) %>% 
    summarize(product_name) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = "aisle",
        values_from = "aisle_count") %>% 
    knitr::kable(align = 'c')
```


```{r TEST CODE, eval=FALSE}
instacart %>% 
    group_by(user_id, order_id) %>% 
    select(order_id, user_id, everything())
```

## Problem #2
###### (*25 points*)
##### *Exploration of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System Data*

The following code imports the `brfss` dataset from the courses' `p8105.datasets` github site. We clean the column/variable names; filter the dataset down to only the `"Overall Health"` topic; and coerce and relevel the `response` (character) variable into a factor variable with reordered factors going from `"Poor"` to "`Excellent"`.

```{r generate_tibble_from_source_data_brfss}
brfss <- as_tibble(p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
    mutate(
        response = fct_relevel(response, c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")),
        county = str_to_lower(str_sub(locationdesc, 5, -1))) %>% 
    rename(
        data_value_pct = data_value,
        state = locationabbr,
        cl_lower = confidence_limit_low,
        cl_upper = confidence_limit_high) %>% 
    select(year, state, county, response, sample_size, data_value_pct, respid, geo_location) %>% 
    view()
```

```{r}

```
